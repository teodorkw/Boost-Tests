# Unit tests using Boost.Test

Tests are driven, where project "Tests" is marked as a startup one.

In order to get desired diagnostic output, one need specify suitable [log level](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_67_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/utf_reference/rt_param_reference/log_level.html).

Usage of Boost.Test module requires library to be built.
